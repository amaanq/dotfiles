# # DESCRIPTION:
# # imwheel configuration settings to speed up the scroll speed for these applications, as a
# # multiplier by the numerical integer value at the end of the first two rows of each block.
#
# # Note: to get an idea for what name to use for each application, as specified at the top of each
# # configuration block below, open the application of interest to get its process(es) running, then
# # search for its name among all running processes like this:
# #       ps aux | grep 'application_name'
