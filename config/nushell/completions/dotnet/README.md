# .NET CLI completions

Completions for the .NET CLI (`dotnet`), which comes with .NET SDK.
.NET is, to quote the official documentation, an "open-source developer platform for building many different types of applications".

For more information, see

- [Installation instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/),
- [CLI documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/),
- [General dotnet documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/).

This plugin uses built-in `dotnet complete` command, which unfortunately does not provide comments for the completions.
On the other hand, it is officially supported, and completions are always in sync with the installed .NET SDK.
For hand-crafted completions, see ones generated from Fish: (../auto-generate/completions/dotnet.nu).
